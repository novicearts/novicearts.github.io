Topics worth discussing:

1st: this site is more like a manual on how to implement certain features, and explains clearly their benefits. Think of it more like a personal notebook on game development, and some cool tricks on how to do certain things.

Some of these topics are things I've personally struggled with

Question: How do I enable the ability to petition questions on the web page, both in general, and by highlighting a specific paragraph?

Game Architecture:
	State Machines
		references: gameprogrammingpattern's State Pattern article
		- Array(Or Hashmap) Style Dictionaries
		- Implementing a hybrid state machine, concurrent + pushdown + hierarchical



Game/Interactive Programming notes:
	- random topics based on things I've discovered how to do
	- setting up  a properly integrated build setup, with everything included, using only a basic makefile setup

PWDL Implementation:
	Pre-req, PWDL 2.0 must be implemented and in proper working order
	- Language parsing
	- expression parsing
	- expression serialization

Unity Specific:
	- Universal Property Drawer Serialization
	- Integrating an Editor Window with a Property Drawer
	- Manually implementing ConnectedComponents to get sprite slices in unity
	- Creating an Aseprite auto importer using AssetProcessor
	- Input Architecture
